// dynamicResourceClient is an interface that allows callers to watch arbitrary resource types
// in Kubernetes. It's passed to functions that expect to call 'Watch()' on the returned
// watch.Interface and convert the returned event objects to such an arbitrary resource type.
// Generally such functions will take this interface so they can be more easily unit tested.
//
// this interface has two important implementations:
//
// - realDynamicResourceClient - a Kubernetes implementation that's based on
//	 a *(k8s.io/client-go/dynamic).ResourceClient
// - fakeDynamicResourceClient - a manually-driven implementation that should be used in unit
//   tests
